## Learning Objectives:bulb:
What you should learn from this project:

* Why Python programming is awesome
* What is a superclass, baseclass or parentclass
* What is a subclass
* How to list all attributes and methods of a class or instance
* When can an instance have new attributes
* How to inherit class from another
* How to define a class with multiple base classes
* What is the default class every class inherit from
* How to override a method or attribute inherited from the base class
* Which attributes or methods are available by heritage to subclasses
* What is the purpose of inheritance
* What are, when and how to use isinstance, issubclass, type and super built-in functions

## Tasks:notebook:  

* `0-lookup.py`: write a function that returns the list of available attributes and methods of an object  
* `1-my_list.py`: write a class MyList that inherits from list  
* `2-is_same_class.py`: write a function that returns True if the object is exactly an instance of the specified class ; otherwise False  
* `3-is_kind_of_class.py`: write a function that returns True if the object is an instance of, or if the object is an instance of a class that inherited from, the specified class ; otherwise False  
* `4-inherits_from.py`: write a function that returns True if the object is an instance of a class that inherited (directly or indirectly) from the specified class ; otherwise False  
* `5-base_geometry.py`: write an empty class BaseGeometry  
* `6-base_geometry.py`: write a class BaseGeometry (based on 5-base_geometry.py)  
* `7-base_geometry.py`: write a class BaseGeometry (based on 6-base_geometry.py)
