## Tasks:notebook:  

* `0-square.py`: write a class Square that defines a square  
* `1-square.py`: write a class Square that defines a square (based on `0-square.py`)  
* `2-square.py`: write a class Square that defines a square (based on `1-square.py`)  
* `3-square.py`: write a class Square that defines a square (based on `2-square.py`)  
* `4-square.py`: write a class Square that defines a square (based on `3-square.py`)
