* Why Python programming is awesome
* How to import functions from another file
* How to use imported functions
* How to create a module
* How to use the built-in function dir()
* How to prevent code in your script from being executed when imported
* How to use command line arguments with your Python programs
* What’s the difference between errors and exceptions
* What are exceptions and how to use them

* `2-variable_load.py`: write a program that imports the variable a from the file variable_load_2.py and prints its value  
* `3-safe_print_division.py`: write a function that divides 2 integers and prints the result  
* `4-raise_exception.py`: write a function that raises a type exception  
* `5-raise_exception_msg.py`: write a function that raises a name exception with a message
