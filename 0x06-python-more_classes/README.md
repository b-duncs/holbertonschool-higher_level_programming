## Tasks:notebook:  

* `0-rectangle.py`: write a class Rectangle that defines a rectangle  
* `1-rectangle.py`: write a class Rectangle that defines a rectangle (based on 0-rectangle.py)  
* `2-rectangle.py`: write a class Rectangle that defines a rectangle (based on 1-rectangle.py)
* `3-rectangle.py`: write a class Rectangle that defines a rectangle (based on 2-rectangle.py)
